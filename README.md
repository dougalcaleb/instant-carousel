Patch Notes:

v0.2.0:
* Features:
    * Implemented infinite drag scroll - it is no longer limited to the center slide and the two adjacent to it
* Bugfixes:
    * Scrolling quickly with fewer pages caused a pop-in effect
    * Some transitions were not being reset correctly in certain conditions. Switched to a css-class based method instead
    * A single frame of the wrong page could show up when swiping between pages
    * The first page wouldn't accept dragging when not an infinite carousel
    * 4 jitter issues related to edge resistance and non-infinite scrolling
    * Dragging through multiple pages caused transitions to not reset correctly
    * Some global event listeners were not being reset correctly
    * Dragging and then step-scrolling back to the initial page would cause some pages to disappear
v0.1.0:
* Features:
    * New type: static. All pages are directly next to each other and fill the entire wrapper.
    * Fully implemented swipe/drag scrolling on "static" type
    * Autoscroll
    * Auto-generating HTML and CSS structure
    * User interaction throttling
